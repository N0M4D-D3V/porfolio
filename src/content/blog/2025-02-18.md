The 14-day waiting period is dragging on longer than I expected. Finding productive “side quests” to focus on hasn’t been easy.
<br/>

### Hunting Bugs

During the wait, I found a few minor issues… and one major one: February apparently had 32 days in my app. I fixed the algorithm, but decided not to push the update to Google Play just yet. I didn’t want to risk having to restart the entire 14-day tester period. I’ll wait until the official release to roll out all hotfixes collected during testing.

### Planning Ahead

With some free mental space, I’ve been sketching the next steps for Fitness Hub and giving this website a more personal, polished UX. My planning falls into three main areas:
<br/><br/>

- **<!> Market Validation:** Before monetizing, I need to confirm there’s real demand and better understand my users. Ideas: surveys, direct feedback, and usage analytics tools.
- **<!> User Growth Strategy:** Without ads, organic growth is essential. Potential tactics: ASO (App Store Optimization), a landing page and blog, community marketing, and referral systems.
- **<!> Monetization Strategy:** Since the app will launch free, the transition to paid features should feel natural. Possible options: selling workout plans and diets (one-time or subscription), exclusive drops for fitness apparel, AI-powered coaching (monthly subscription), and real personal training services (monthly subscription).

<br/>

## The Roadmap

For now, the goal is simple: release a stable MVP, let people use it, and collect feedback. The next phase will be launching a small premium feature MVP, testing pricing, and gathering user insights before scaling.
