Beneath the waves where sunlight fades,  
In ocean depths, where giants wade,  
The whales glide slow, a gentle force,  
On ancient trails, a timeless course.  

Their songs, a chorus vast and deep,  
Echo through the oceanâ€™s keep,  
A melody both mournful, wise,  
That lifts the sea and stirs the skies.  

Their shadows loom, yet hearts are kind,  
Great sentinels of seas entwined,  
Through ages long, they've journeyed far,  
Guided by the pull of stars.  

Oh, whales, you carry ocean's lore,  
A bridge to worlds we can't explore,  
In every dive, in every crest,  
You hold the ocean's soul confessed.
