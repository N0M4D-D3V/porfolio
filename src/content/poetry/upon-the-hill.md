Upon the hill, the meadow sings,  
A lullaby on twilightâ€™s wings,  
The trees, like guardians, stand tall,  
In whispers soft, they tell it all.  

The stream hums low, a gentle tune,  
Reflecting shards of rising moon,  
Its waters weave through mossy stone,  
A path of light where dreams have flown.  

And in this stillness, hearts find rest,  
A fleeting calm, a gift, a guest,  
For though the world may spin and roar,  
The night restores what day implores.
