Beneath a sky where twilight lingers,  
The whispering wind threads through my fingers,  
Carrying secrets from lands unknown,  
Stories of mountains, moss-covered stone.  

It hums through forests, ancient and wise,  
Where shadows stretch and fireflies rise,  
Its voice a song both mournful and sweet,  
Dancing with leaves at the trees’ rooted feet.  

Oh, restless wind, what tales you keep,  
Of oceans vast, of valleys deep,  
Of wanderers lost and paths untamed,  
Of love found fleeting, and hearts reclaimed.  

Yet as you pass, your whispers fade,  
Like fleeting dreams in dawn's cascade.  
You leave a touch, a fleeting sigh,  
A gentle promise: I’ll always fly.  

So, here I stand where the grasses bend,  
A witness to your journey’s end.  
Carry me too, in your timeless quest,  
For in your breath, my soul finds rest.
