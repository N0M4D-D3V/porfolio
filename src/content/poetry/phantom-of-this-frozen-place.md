High in the realms where silence reigns,  
Where icy cliffs defy the plains,  
The snow leopard moves, a shadowed grace,  
A phantom of this frozen place.  

Its coat, a storm of silver hue,  
Specked with dusk, kissed by dew,  
Each step a whisper, soft and sly,  
Blending with the cobalt sky.  

Eyes like embers, fierce and bright,  
Pierce the veil of endless night,  
Guardian of the peaks so sheer,  
A fleeting ghost, both far and near.  

Majestic hunter, proud and free,  
Keeper of the wild decree,  
In your domain, a tale is spun,  
Of winter’s heart and mountain’s sun.
