Beneath the quiet sky’s embrace,  
The moonlight drapes the world in grace,  
Whispers of wind in gentle sway,  
As stars adorn the endless bay.  

The earth sleeps soft, in peace it lays,  
A silent song, the night’s ballet,  
In dreams, the dawn will softly creep,  
But now, the night, in silence, keeps.  

A world of wonder wrapped in night,  
Where shadows dance in silver light,  
Each moment holds a timeless call,  
A quiet peace that cradles all.
