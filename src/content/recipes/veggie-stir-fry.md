    - 2 tbsp
    - 1 tbsp
    - 2 (sliced)
    - 1 tbsp
    - 2 cups (cooked)

instructions:
  - Press the tofu to remove excess moisture, then cut into cubes.
  - Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Set aside.
  - In the same pan, add sesame oil and saut√© garlic and ginger until fragrant.
  - Add the bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, and snow peas to the pan. Stir-fry for 4-5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
  - Stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a splash of water to create a light sauce.
  - Add the tofu back to the pan and toss everything together, cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
  - Serve the stir-fry over cooked rice, garnished with green onions, sesame seeds, and a drizzle of additional soy sauce if desired.

notes:
  - You can use any mix of vegetables you like or have on hand.
  - For a spicier version, add some chili flakes or a dash of sriracha to the sauce.
  - If you're not into tofu, this dish can easily be made with tempeh or even seitan.
  - Make sure the rice is cooked and ready before starting the stir-fry to save time.
