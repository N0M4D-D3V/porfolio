ingredients:
  list:
    - Pizza dough
    - Canned San Marzano tomatoes
    - Fresh mozzarella
    - Fresh basil leaves
    - Olive oil
    - Salt
    - Garlic (optional)
  qty:
    - 1 ball
    - 1 can (14 oz)
    - 8 oz
    - 8-10 leaves
    - some
    - pinch
    - 1 clove

instructions:
  - Preheat your oven to its maximum temperature (usually 500°F/260°C) and place a pizza stone inside, if available.
  - Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.
  - Blend the canned tomatoes with a pinch of salt (and garlic, if desired) to create a simple pizza sauce.
  - Spread a thin layer of sauce over the rolled-out dough.
  - Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and evenly distribute it over the sauce.
  - Bake the pizza directly on the stone (or a baking sheet) for 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
  - Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil.
  - Let the pizza rest for a minute before slicing and serving.

notes:
  - For an extra crispy crust, let the dough rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.
  - Avoid overloading the pizza with sauce or cheese to maintain a balanced flavor and texture.
  - San Marzano tomatoes make a noticeable difference in flavor, but any high-quality tomatoes can work.
  - Pair this pizza with a simple arugula salad for a complete meal.
