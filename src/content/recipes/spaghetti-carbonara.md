prepTime: 30
servings: 4

ingredients:
  list:
    - Spaghetti
    - Pancetta (or guanciale)
    - Eggs
    - Pecorino Romano
    - Black pepper
    - Salt
    - Garlic (optional)
  qty:
    - 12 oz
    - 6 oz (diced)
    - 3 large
    - 1 cup (finely grated)
    - some (freshly ground)
    - pinch
    - 1 clove (smashed)

instructions:
  - Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
  - While the pasta cooks, heat a skillet over medium heat and sauté the pancetta until crispy (add garlic for flavor, then discard if desired).
  - In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, Pecorino Romano, and black pepper until smooth.
  - Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta, tossing to combine.
  - Remove the skillet from heat and quickly mix in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing to coat the pasta evenly. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time to create a silky sauce.
  - Adjust seasoning with salt and more black pepper as needed.
  - Serve immediately, topped with extra Pecorino and a sprinkling of black pepper.

notes:
  - For authenticity, use guanciale instead of pancetta if available.
  - Work quickly when adding the egg mixture to avoid scrambling.
  - Avoid cream in carbonara—it’s not traditional!
  - Pair with a crisp white wine or sparkling water with lemon.
