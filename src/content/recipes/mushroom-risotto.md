instructions:
  - Heat the vegetable broth in a pot and keep it warm on low heat.
  - In a large skillet, heat olive oil and sauté the mushrooms until browned; set aside.
  - Add butter to the same skillet and cook the shallot and garlic until fragrant.
  - Stir in the Arborio rice, cooking for 1-2 minutes until lightly toasted.
  - Deglaze the pan with white wine, stirring until the liquid is absorbed.
  - Begin adding the warm broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more.
  - After 20-25 minutes, when the rice is creamy and tender, stir in the sautéed mushrooms, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.
  - Remove from heat and let sit for a minute before serving.
  - Garnish with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan if desired.

notes:
  - Use a mix of mushrooms for a deeper, more complex flavor.
  - Stirring frequently is key to achieving the creamy texture of risotto.
  - For a non-vegetarian option, substitute chicken broth for vegetable broth.
  - Serve with a crisp white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.
