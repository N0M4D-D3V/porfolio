In 2020, I started in the tech industry. Since then, I have worked for large companies such as Merlin Properties, Airbus Defence And Space, and Codere NEWCO. I have always held positions as a multidisciplinary developer/analyst specializing in cross-platform applications. I've done it all: hybrid and web applications, desktop applications, team management, setting up servers, automation scripts, backends...

<br/>

In 2025, I published ['Fitness Hub'](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.fitness.hub) and ['AutoTrade Pro'](https://autotrade-pro.com). My current goal is to make a living from software without depending on third-party companies.

<br/>

About me: I like computing, music, and fitness. I've always been creative, analytical, and intellectually curious. If you want to know more about me, I invite you to visit my blog. I'm sure you'll find interesting articles.
