The forbidden arts are shrouded in mystery and fear, often whispered about in hushed tones. Those who study these disciplines walk a precarious line between power and ruin. Proceed with caution, for the price of mastery is steep.

## Demonology: The Art of Binding

Demonology focuses on summoning and controlling infernal entities. Practitioners seek to harness demonic power to achieve their goals, often at great personal risk.

### Ritual of Summoning

To summon a minor demon:

1. Draw a summoning circle with chalk, using precise glyphs.
2. Place an offering (blood or an object of significant value) at the circle's center.
3. Speak the incantation: _"Daemoni, servitium mihi praebe."_

### Warnings

- A poorly drawn circle may lead to the summoner's demise.
- Demons are bound by the letter of an agreement, not its spirit.

### Example Pact

| **Demon Name** | **Domain** | **Price**               |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Zarkalth       | Knowledge  | Memories of a loved one |
| Imorath        | Strength   | A year of servitude     |
| Felmira        | Illusions  | A sliver of your soul   |

## Occult Rituals: Weaving Shadows

Occult practitioners draw upon ambient energies and dark forces to achieve extraordinary feats. Unlike demonology, these arts do not involve sentient entities but still require immense discipline.

### Ritual: Veil of Shadows

The _Veil of Shadows_ cloaks the caster in darkness, rendering them nearly invisible for one minute.

#### Steps:

1. Light a black candle and surround it with obsidian shards.
2. Chant: _"Umbra celare animam meam."_
3. Snuff the candle with your hand to activate the veil.

> **Note**: Prolonged exposure to shadow magic can cause physical and mental exhaustion.

## Curses and Hexes

The forbidden arts also encompass curses and hexes, tools of vengeance for those who wish to harm their enemies. However, curses often rebound on the caster if improperly performed.

### Example Hex

**The Withering Touch**: Weakens the victim over several days.

#### Materials Required:

- A lock of the victim's hair
- A withered leaf
- A vial of stagnant water

#### Procedure:

1. Burn the leaf and hair together, collecting the ashes.
2. Mix the ashes into the water while reciting: _"Debilitatem te premo."_
3. Pour the mixture onto the ground, sealing the hex.

## The Price of Power

The forbidden arts demand sacrifice. Whether it be your vitality, your sanity, or your very soul, mastery of these practices is never free.

### Advice for Practitioners

1. Always research your rituals meticulously; a single misstep can be fatal.
2. Keep protective wards active whenever practicing demonology.
3. Never underestimate the cost of a pact, and always plan for contingencies.

Will you dare to embrace the forbidden, or will you leave these arts buried in the shadows where they belong?
