Throughout my professional journey, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects: websites, landing pages, hybrid applications, Android applications, automations, and Python bots, among others. In all of them, I learned many things.
<br/><br/>

The problem was that this knowledge often got lost or left behind as we moved on to new projects. So, I rolled up my sleeves and decided to create my own personal library. And to make it even more epic, I invited Juan Carlos Arráez to join and share his magic 🪄! Thus, Demiurge was born.
<br/><br/>

Since I started working on Demiurge, I've seen numerous benefits, especially in my personal projects.

- 💻 **Development Efficiency:** Now I can work more efficiently by having pre-programmed or almost ready-to-use elements.

- 🧩 **Abstraction and Versatility:** Every time I think about adding something to the library, I make sure to do it in an extremely reusable and modular way. This makes reuse easier while also honing my abstraction skills.

- ⚒️ **Consistency in Code Quality:** By using previously tested components, I can maintain a consistent level of quality across all my projects. Moreover, each iteration allows me to introduce improvements that further strengthen the robustness of my code.

- 🤝 **Facilitates Collaboration:** This library has also facilitated collaboration by sharing common resources, which greatly helps foster teamwork and coherence in development.

Unfortunately, I have the library hosted in a private repository and cannot share it, at least for now. I believe there is still much work to be done. However, this 'venture' has taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of building utilities that optimize our work and, at the same time, allow for learning.
<br/><br/>

In fact, I am considering the possibility of dividing Demiurge into more specialized modules. I believe this will further increase code reuse and improve its flexibility.
<br/><br/>

In summary, the journey of building my personal library has been an interesting adventure. Although I can't share my work for now, my goal is to continue refining it for my own benefit, and hopefully others someday.
