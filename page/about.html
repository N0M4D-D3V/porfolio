      <h3>Cross-platform Applications</h3>

        <span class="icon-1 icon-1-1"></span>
        Designed and developed to run on
        <b>multiple operating systems or platforms</b>. Rather than building
        separate native apps for each platform , a cross-platform app leverages
        technologies that allow the codebase to be shared and executed across
        different platforms.

      <h3>Cost-Effective Solution</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="icon-1 icon-1-4"></span>
        My approach of leveraging cross-platform frameworks and technologies
        offers <b>cost benefits</b> for your business. Instead of building
        separate native applications, I utilize a single codebase that can be
        deployed across multiple platforms, saving development costs and
        reducing time-to-market.

      <h3>Efficient Dev Process</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="icon-1 icon-1-5"></span>
        Multiplatform development streamlines the development process, resulting
        in <b>quicker turnaround times and efficient resource allocation</b>. By
        leveraging reusable code and cross-platform tools, libraries, or
        frameworks, I ensure faster development cycles and simplified
        maintenance, leading to increased productivity and cost savings.
