        Java served as my foundation in programming. Along the way, I delved
        into various languages, including
        <b>C#, Python, JavaScript, and Kotlin</b>. However, serendipity led me
        to specialize in <b>Typescript</b>. Leveraging frameworks like
        <b>Angular, Ionic, Electron, and Capacitor</b>, I craft apps.
